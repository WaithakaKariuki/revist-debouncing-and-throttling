## Differences between debouncing and throttling.

Debouncing is a technique in programming that helps prevent time-consuming tasks from being triggered so frequently that they slow down the performance of a web page. In simpler terms, it controls how often a function is called.

In JavaScript, debouncing is commonly used to enhance browser performance. Sometimes, certain actions on a web page involve complex computations that take up time. If these actions are triggered too frequently, it can significantly impact the browserâ€™s performance, especially since JavaScript operates on a single thread. 

Throttling is a technique that is used to throttle or ignore the continuous occurrence of a particular event or task for a particular interval of time and execute the code again after that specified time if the event or the task continues occurring. It can be used with the resize and the scroll events to avoid sending frequent server requests.

Throttling is very commonly used on web pages which loads some data on scroll. It is used to send requests to the server after a particular interval of time if the user continues to scroll the web page. That is why you sometimes see the loading icon when you continuously scroll a web page like Instagram or Facebook.

### Debouncing

- It is used to delay the execution of a function if it is called continuously.
- It is used to handle events that fire quickly like user input.
- It clears the previous timer on each function call and sets a new one every time.

### Throttling

- Throttling sometimes also called throttle function is a practice used in websites. Throttling is used to call a function after every millisecond or a particular interval of time only the first click is executed immediately.

- Without throttling, a function may be invoked rapidly, leading to performance issues, unnecessary resource consumption, and a potentially poor user experience. 

- It limits the invocation of a function by invoking it after a certain interval of time if it is called continuously.
- It is mainly used with the scroll or resize events to limit the frequency of function calls.
- It maintains a constant limit between the invocation of two function calls.

#### Advantages of throttling function: 

- It prevents frequent calling of the function.
- It makes the website faster and controls the rate at which a particular function is called.
- Performance Optimization.
- Improved Responsiveness.

### Conclusion:

Debouncing and throttling are powerful techniques for managing user input and optimizing API requests in React applications. By incorporating these strategies with React hooks, we can create more efficient and responsive user interfaces. With the easy-to-understand example provided in this article, even beginners can grasp the concept of debouncing and throttling and apply them to their React projects.

- Debouncing: Delays execution until after a pause; good for reducing function calls after rapid events.
- Throttling: Limits execution to once per specified interval; good for ensuring a function runs at regular intervals.
